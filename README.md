<br>Problem Statement: The nature of student engagement has changed. As a company that values the talent and ideas that college students bring, we want to ensure that we're engaging with students on their terms. The goal of this challenge is to create a tool that will allow us to collect valuable information about a student's experiences and <i><b>interests</b><i/> in order to partner through internships, co-ops, and other opportunities. </br>
<br></br>
<br>The word, "interests", is worth highlighting as it was what we chose to focus on when designing LinkedUp. We want to allow students to share their career, academic, or personal interets and be matched with employees that share similar interests. It's the connections that students make that will help them land their next job, which is what we believe LinkedUp will achieve.</br>
